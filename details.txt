4. Paginated Content Viewer
Objective: Implement a content viewer with pagination for seamless browsing through a large dataset.
Challenge: Divide a large dataset into pages and provide navigation controls to allow users to navigate through the content easily.
Skills tested: Pagination, data manipulation, conditional rendering

Tasks:
    Design a content viewer UI with pagination controls such as previous, next, and page numbers.
    Paginate the dataset into smaller chunks based on the selected page.
    Render the current page of content dynamically based on the user’s navigation.
    Display pagination controls conditionally based on the size of the dataset and current page.

5. Smart Product Filter
Objective: Develop an advanced product filtering system for e-commerce, enabling users to find products based on specific criteria.
Challenge: Implement filter options such as category, price range, brand, and other attributes, allowing users to narrow down product listings according to their preferences.
Skills tested: Filtering logic, user interface design, data manipulation

Tasks:
    Design a product filtering UI with options for category, price range, brand, and other attributes.

    Display filtered results in real-time as users adjust filter settings.
    Provide feedback to users when no products match the selected criteria.
    Optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary data fetching or rendering.
Hints:
    Use React useState hook to manage filter state and apply filtering logic to product data.
    Create separate components for each filter option to encapsulate their behavior.
    Utilize array methods like filter and map to manipulate product data based on filter criteria.
    Implement debounce or throttle techniques to avoid excessive re-rendering during filter adjustments.
    Consider adding sorting options to allow users to further customize their product listings.
